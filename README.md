# cow.aim

Cow.aim is a 2D "Aim Training" shooter game with 2 different gamemodes: "Flick", where the player shoots static targets spaced out on the canvas, and "Track", where the player tracks a single moving target. It also features toggleable settings to change crosshair color and crosshair size.

Cow.aim was developed as my final project for CS136 using Professor Bern's Cow.java library.
